## Overview

This is my reason for participating in this challenge: to improve my front-end skills.

As a frontend developer, it could become difficult to improve in your learning journey as the time to work on side projects and also explore new and exciting technologies seems to be gone.

This is where the frontend challenges on Frontend Mentor come in handy. Not only do you get to improve your frontend skills, but you also get to tackle these challenges with those new technologies you've been meaning to explore for a while. (I'm looking at you, typescript.)

## Solved Challenges
